# CogSci-Final-Project-A-Computational-Model-of-the-Phonological-Loop
Welcome! This is the repository for our groupâ€™s final project in Intro to Cognitive Science. We explore and extend a classic computational model of the phonological loop by modifying its decay and rehearsal mechanisms, and incorporating semantic similarity using word embeddings. All code is written in MATLAB and available here.
